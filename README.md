# Euler Solutions

This is a tiny project in order to keep track of my solutions to [Euler Project](http://projecteuler.net).

The problem is descibed in the solution files named as 10.py, which means it is the solution to problem No.10 using python programming language.

I will try to solve one singe problem each day( or approximately 300 in a year) though I know it will become more and more difficult on the way. We will see anyway.

Any advice and idea about the problem, algorithm and code is extremely welcomed. In fact the reason why I decided to put it here is that I want to improve my skill of solving these math and computer science mixed problems and I do need your help.

I'm new to python so I will try to solve every problem in python at first. But I may rewrite it in other language or even not in programs. 

Let me know what you think.
